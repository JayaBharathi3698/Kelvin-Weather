# Kelvin-Weather
Problem Statement :
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.  
Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website.
However thereâ€™s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin. 
Try helping kelvin to convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.
